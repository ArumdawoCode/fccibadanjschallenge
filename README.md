# fccibadanjschallenge
WesBos 30Days of Javascript challenge for Ibadan FreeCodeCampers

This is a collective project of the FCC Ibadan group to help us stick to the plan of taking the challenge one day at a time. 

Also, it is designed to make us accountable to our individual selves.

More importantly, it will help many of us practice our git usage.
